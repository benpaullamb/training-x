		exercise: 'BARBELL FLAT BENCH PRESSES',
		muscle: 'Chest',
		execution: [
			'Lie on a flat bench, your feet on the floor for balance. Your grip should be medium-wide (which means that as you lower the bar to your chest, your hands should be wide enough apart so that your forearms point straight up, perpendicular to the floor). Lift the bar off the rack and hold it at arm’s length above you.',
			'Lower the bar slowly and under control until it touches just below the pectoral muscles. Keep the elbows pointed outward in order to fully involve the chest. The bar should come to a complete stop at this point. Press the bar upward once more until your arms are fully locked out. Always go through a full range of motion unless instructed specifically to do otherwise.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To build mass and strength in the pectorals, front delts, and triceps. The Bench Press is a fundamental compound exercise for the upper body. It produces growth, strength, and muscle density, not only for the chest muscles but for the front deltoids and triceps as well.',

		exercise: 'BARBELL INCLINE BENCH PRESSES',
		muscle: 'Chest',
		execution: [
			'Lie back on an incline bench. Reach up and grasp the bar with a medium-wide grip. Lift the bar off the rack and hold it straight up overhead, arms locked.',
			'Lower the weight down to the upper chest, stop for a moment, then press it back up to the starting position. When working at an incline, it is extremely important to find the right “groove” or you are likely to find the bar drifting too far forward. It is useful to have a training partner to spot you while you are getting used to this movement.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To develop the mass and strength of the pectoral muscles (middle and upper regions) and front deltoids. Changing the angle of the movement so you are pressing at an incline tends to put extra stress on the upper chest muscles and make the deltoids work harder. But you will find you can’t lift as much weight as you can when doing a Flat Bench Press.',

		exercise: 'STRAIGHT-ARM PULLOVERS',
		muscle: 'Chest',
		execution: [
			'Place a dumbbell on a bench, then turn and lie across the bench with only your shoulders on its surface, your feet flat on the floor. Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight up over your chest, with both palms pressing against the underside of the top plate.',
			'Keeping your arms straight, lower the weight slowly down in an arc behind your head, feeling the chest and rib cage stretch. Drop the hips toward the floor at the same time to increase this stretch. When you have lowered the dumbbell as far as possible, raise it back to the starting position through the same arc. Don’t let your hips come back up as you lift the weight. Keep them low throughout the movement to ensure the maximum possible stretch and therefore the greatest expansion of the rib cage.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To develop the pectorals and expand the rib cage. This is the best movement for expanding the thorax as well as working the pectorals and building up the serratus anterior muscles.',

		exercise: 'CLOSE-GRIP CHINS',
		muscle: 'Back',
		execution: [
			'Take hold of the chinning bar (or close-grip triangle device found in many gyms) with your hands close together, one hand on either side of the bar. Hang below the bar.',
			'Then pull yourself up while leaning your head back slightly so that the chest touches (or nearly touches) your hands; lower the body slowly for a full stretch of the lats. Work for the fullest range of motion.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To work the back muscles, widen the lower lats, and develop the serratus. This exercise is great for widening and lengthening the appearance of the lats. It also develops the serratus anterior, those little fingers of muscle that lie under the outside of the pecs, which add so much to front poses such as double-biceps or any other overhead pose.',
	},
	{
		exercise: 'BENT-OVER BARBELL ROWS',
		muscle: 'Back',
		execution: [
			'Standing with feet a few inches apart, grasp the bar with a wide, overhand grip. With your knees slightly bent, bend forward until your upper body is about parallel to the floor. Keep your back straight, head up, and let the bar hang at arm’s length below you, almost touching the shinbone.',
			'Using primarily the muscles of the back, lift the bar upward until it touches the upper abdominals, then lower it again, under control, back to the starting position; then immediately start your next rep. It is important to make the back work so as not to make this a biceps exercise. Think of the arms and hands as hooks, a way of transmitting the contraction of the lats to the bar. Don’t bring the bar up to the chest area itself; bringing it only to the abdomen reduces the role of the arms. Make sure your first set of any rowing exercise is relatively light to let your back get warmed up. By the time you get to your last set, a little bit of cheating is all right to get you through it, but keep it to a minimum.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To thicken the upper back. This exercise also helps widen the upper back and, to a lesser degree, adds density to the lower back.',

		exercise: 'STANDING LATERAL RAISES',
		muscle: 'Shoulders',
		execution: [
			'Take a dumbbell in each hand, bend forward slightly, and bring the weights together in front of you at arm’s length. Start each repetition from a dead stop to keep yourself from swinging the weight up.',
			'Lift the weights out and up to either side, turning your wrists slightly (as if pouring water out of a pitcher) so that the rear of the dumbbell is higher than the front.',
			'Lift the weights to a point slightly higher than your shoulders, then lower them slowly, resisting all the way down. (A common mistake with this movement is to rock back and forth and swing the weights up instead of lifting them with the deltoids. Doing this cuts down on the effectiveness of the movement and should be avoided.)',
			'VARIATION: You may have a tendency to cheat a little when doing Standing Lateral Raises—this can be avoided if the same exercise is done in a seated position.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To develop the outside head of the deltoid, with secondary benefit to the front and rear heads.',

		exercise: 'HEAVY UPRIGHT ROWS',
		muscle: 'Shoulders',
		execution: [
			'Choose a heavy barbell and grasp it with an overhand grip, hands about 12 inches apart. Let the bar hang down at arm’s length in front of you.',
			'Lift the bar straight up to a point just below your chin, allowing yourself to cheat by swaying with the back, pushing with the legs, and even helping with the calves. As you lift, keep your elbows out and up higher than the bar. Then lower the bar back to the starting position. Remember, this is a power movement in which cheating plays a vital part. This makes Heavy Upright Rows quite a different exercise from standard Upright Rows, which must be done very strictly.',
		],
		purpose:
			'A heavy cheating movement for advanced bodybuilders to strengthen the entire shoulder girdle and upper back.',

	{
		exercise: 'PUSH PRESSES',
		muscle: 'Shoulders',
		execution: [
			'Taking hold of a barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart, clean the weight up to shoulder height.',
			'Bend your knees slightly and then press up with your legs to get the bar moving. Use this additional impetus to press the bar up overhead. Lock it out, then slowly lower once more to shoulder position.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To use a heavier than normal weight, or to continue to do repetitions of shoulder presses after reaching a point of failure; to develop additional deltoid strength. This is a Cheating Principle exercise. You can use it in power training to lift a barbell that you would normally find too heavy to use for strict Shoulder Presses. You can also use the Push Press to do forced reps at the end of a set, when you are too tired to continue to do strict Shoulder Press reps.',

		exercise: 'STANDING BARBELL CURLS',
		muscle: 'Biceps',
		execution: [
			'Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and grasp the bar with an underhand grip, hands about shoulder width apart. Let the bar hang down at arm’s length in front of you.',
			'Curl the bar out and up in a wide arc and bring it up as high as you can, with your elbows close to the body and stationary. Keep the arc wide and long, rather than bringing the bar straight up and making the movement too easy. Fully flex at the top. Lower the weight again, following the same arc and resisting the weight all the way down until your arms are fully extended. A small amount of body movement in this exercise is acceptable because it is a mass-building movement, but this is to be kept to a minimum unless you are doing deliberate Cheat Curls. Bending forward and leaning back cut down on your range of motion.',

		purpose:
			'To develop the overall size of the biceps. This is the most basic and popular of biceps exercises.',

		exercise: 'STANDING TRICEPS PRESSES',
		muscle: 'Triceps',
		execution: [
			'Grip a straight or E-Z curl bar with an overhand grip, hands about 10 inches apart. Stand upright and hold the bar extended straight overhead.',
			'Keeping your elbows stationary and close to your head, lower the weight down behind your head as far as possible, then press it back up to the starting position through a semicircular arc.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To develop the full sweep of the triceps. Doing this movement gives your triceps a full look to complement the biceps when doing a double-biceps pose. Performing Triceps Presses standing instead of seated allows you to do a cheating movement and thus use more weight. This exercise can also be done with a cable and rope through a floor-level pulley, which puts greater emphasis on the long head of the triceps.',

		exercise: 'SEATED DUMBBELL CURLS',
		muscle: 'Biceps',
		execution: [
			'Sit on the end of a flat bench, or against the back support of an incline bench adjusted to an upright position, a dumbbell in each hand held straight down at arm’s length, palms turned toward your body.',
			'Holding your elbows steady as unmoving pivot points, curl the weights forward and up, twisting your palms forward as you lift so that the thumbs turn to the outside and the palms are facing up. Lift the weights as high as you can and then give an extra flex of the biceps to achieve maximum contraction. Lower the dumbbells down through the same arc, resisting the weight all the way down, until your arms are fully extended, the biceps stretched as far as possible. Twisting the wrists as you lift and lower the dumbbells causes a fuller contraction of the biceps and develops the inner biceps and separation between biceps and triceps. You can also do this exercise standing instead of seated, which will allow you to use a little more weight, although the movement will not be as strict.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To build, shape, and define the biceps. Doing a standard curl with dumbbells rather than a barbell means you will use slightly less weight, but the arms are left free to move through their natural range of motion and you can achieve an even greater degree of contraction. As with Barbell Curls, you can cheat a little with this exercise, but keep it to a minimum.',

		exercise: 'DUMBBELL ONE-ARM WRIST CURLS',
		muscle: 'Forearms',
		execution: [
			'Take hold of a dumbbell and sit on a bench. Lean forward and place your forearm on your thigh so that your wrist and the weight extend out over the knee, with your palm and the inside of your forearm facing upward. Bend forward, reach over with your free hand, and take hold of the elbow of the working arm to stabilize it. Bend your wrist and lower the weight as far as possible toward the floor, opening your fingers slightly to let the dumbbell roll down out of your palm.',
			'Close your fingers again and, keeping the effort in your wrist, rather than the biceps, curl the weight up as high as you can. Finish your repetitions, then repeat using the other wrist.',

		purpose:
			'To isolate and develop the forearms. This is a variation of Wrist Curls that allows you to isolate one forearm at a time.',

		exercise: 'SQUATS',
		muscle: 'Thighs',
		execution: [
			'With the barbell on a rack, step under it so that it rests across the back of your shoulders, hold on to the bar to balance it, raise up to lift it off the rack, and step away. The movement can be done with your feet flat on the floor or your heels resting on a low block for support.',
			'Keeping your head up and back straight, bend your knees and lower yourself until your thighs are just lower than parallel to the floor. From this point, push yourself back up to the starting position. It is important to go below parallel in this movement, especially when you are just learning the exercise, so that you develop strength along the entire range of motion. If you don’t go low enough in the beginning, you could injure yourself later when using heavier weight. Foot position to some extent determines which area of the thighs you work the most while doing Squats: A wider stance works the inside of the thighs to a greater degree, while a narrower stance tends to work the outside more; toes turned out hits the inside of the thighs. The basic stance for greatest power is usually feet shoulder-width apart, with toes turned just slightly out.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To build mass and strength in the legs, especially the thighs. Full Squats are one of the traditional mass-building exercises for the entire lower body but are primarily for developing all four heads of the quadriceps.',

		exercise: 'STANDING CALF RAISES',
		muscle: 'Calves',

			'Stand with your toes on the block of a standing Calf Raise machine, your heels extended out into space. Hook your shoulders under the pads and straighten your legs, lifting the weight clear of the support. Lower your heels as far as possible toward the floor, keeping your knees slightly bent throughout the movement in order to work the lower area of the calves as well as the upper, and feeling the calf muscles stretch to the maximum. I like a block that is high enough so that I get a full stretch when I lower my heels.',
			'From the bottom of the movement, come up on your toes as far as possible. The weight should be heavy enough to exercise the calves, but not so heavy that you cannot come all the way up for most of your repetitions. When you are too tired to do complete repetitions, finish off the set with a series of partial movements to increase the intensity of the exercise.',

		muscle: 'Back',
		execution: [
			'Place a barbell on the floor in front of you. Bend your knees, lean forward, and grasp the bar in a medium-wide grip, one hand in an overhand grip, the other in an underhand grip. Keep your back fairly straight to protect it from strain. If you curve your back you risk injury.',
			'Begin the lift by driving with the legs. Straighten up until you are standing upright, then throw the chest out and shoulders back as if coming to attention. To lower the weight, bend the knees, lean forward from the waist, and touch the weight to the floor before beginning your next repetition.',
		],
		purpose:
			'To work the lower back. Deadlifts are an overall power exercise that involves more muscles than any other exercise in your routine, including the lower back, upper back, and trapezius muscles, the buttocks, and the legs. A strong lower back is especially important when doing movements like Bent-Over Rows and T-Bar Rows, which put a lot of strain on this area.',

			'Curl your shoulders and trunk upward toward your knees, rounding your back. Don’t try to lift your entire back up off the floor, just roll forward and crunch your rib cage toward your pelvis. At the top of the movement, deliberately give an extra squeeze of the abs to achieve total contraction, then release and lower your shoulders back to the starting position. This is not a movement you do quickly. Do each rep deliberately and under control. You can vary the angle of stress on your abdominals by raising your foot position.
